Hermione Granger attends Hogwarts as one of the few Muggle-born students. Despite her efforts to make a place for herself, her future seems set in stone until Sixth Year, when the Triwizard Tournament is announced and everything begins to change.
“Bloody hell,” Ron says from beside her. “I think that blond tosser in the front is a Malfoy.”
She tears her eyes away to stare at Ron. “A who?”
He laughs and points at the blond boy. “Malfoy. I dunno his first name, but he’s definitely got to be a Malfoy. Old pureblood family from here in Britain. Bastards, the lot of them. Always Slytherins here at Hogwarts. Heard his dad sent him to Durmstrang because he didn’t want his son near any Muggle-borns.”",11 Feb 2024,"42,731"

For years, she's been meeting in secret with a spy within Voldemort's ranks to exchange information.But when she's captured and made prisoner at Malfoy Manor, of all the dark and evil ways she'd envisioned Malfoy would torture her, she never quite imagined anything this horrific.I just wanted to make it abundantly clear that I was originally inspired to write this fic after I read the masterpiece that is Manacled, so I would like to thank SenLinYu for her amazing work! The memory searching aspect of Manacled is what inspired me, and although I have adapted that, (and also made Draco head Death Eater, because... ya know... we all love it when he's Voldemort's right hand man 😅😉),  Secrets and Masks will be a very very different fic all together.",12 Nov 2022,"21,458"

In Draco’s experience, moments, even when simple, had a habit of becoming irretrievable. Moments grew, stretched, multiplied into ages and eras that defined whole stretches of measurable time. Draco regretted several moments in his life, some within his control, some without: all of them irretrievable in nature. At a certain point, wedged between ‘what-ifs’ of his own devising, he’d stopped trying to keep track of those regrettable moments: now and then, pushing and pulling, coming and going, beginning and end. Moments were only moments for just as long. After that, he had no control.
