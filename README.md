# Harry Potter Fanfiction 

## Data and Visualizations of Interest
In this section, I explore harry potter social network density and sentiments based on the Harry Potter fanfiction.
### Example Topics:
- *social network density/theme:**Under a close analysis of reading NLP of a text, there can be a visualization of the theme of the story and the characters network density
- *comparisons of themes and popularity.

### Ideas for Data to Investigate
Also I am interested to see if there is a correlation in genre theme to the most popular stories.

### Specific Dataset Ideas:
- **Government Data:** Analysis of government data on how many enrolled foster youth there are by district and school.
- **Educational Data:** Examination of student performance metrics and their correlation with various socio-economic factors.
- **Downloaded Data:** Data made to analyze the text of the focused story.
- -**Data from Archive of our own** data pulled and cleaned for csv's or charts


### Curated Dataset Ideas:
- **Kaggle Datasets:** Exploration of popular datasets on Kaggle to help compare fanfiction to orignal story.
- **Government Databases:** Utilization of publicly available government datasets like census data.
- **Academic Research:** Leveraging datasets from academic research that could provide contexts into foster youth policy.


## conclusion 
*I will be assessing varying aspects and curating data sets from the fanfiction and/or the foster youth data
